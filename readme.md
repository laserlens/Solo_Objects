# Solo-Object
Reason why I am doing this:
- was the home work assigned
- practice makes perfect
- learn about objects and strings?

Reason why I chose to model this team as an object:
- don't like the sports balls
- know this team intimately
- made the wife angry on 9/20/16 and knew when she looked at the finished product she would stop being mad at me

Output:
In console log, you would get a read able paragraph with object properties inside the string.
For Example: "string" object property "string"...so on
